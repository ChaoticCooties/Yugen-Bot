# Yugen Bot
> A small Discord bot written in discord.py

Yugen Bot is a revolutionary Discord bot made exclusively for the Republic Discord Server. (https://short.repsports.org/discord)
It features autorole based on reactions, as well as a plethora of other minimal features which will be worked on in the future.

## How to Install

There are currently no config files to faciliate easy installations. However, comments in the code should easily provide you with enough knowledge on altering the bot to your server's needs.
Once you've altered the file successfully, on Linux, type in the terminal:
```sh 
cd "the directory where the bot is located"
python3.5 run.py
```
