# Yugen Bot
> A small Discord bot written in discord.py

Yugen Bot is a Discord bot made exclusively for the Republic Discord Server. (https://short.repsports.org/discord)
It features autorole based on reactions, as well as a plethora of other minimal features which will be worked on in the future.

## How to Install

There are currently no config files to faciliate easy installations. However, comments in the code should easily provide you with enough knowledge on altering the bot to your server's needs. You may contact me for any questions regarding installations but I will not provide you with step-by-step instructions.

Once you've altered the file successfully, on Linux, type in the terminal:
```sh 
cd "the directory where the bot is located"
nohup python3.5 run.py
```
(nohup) is optional - Use it if you wish to continue running the script in the background after you closed the session.

For Windows, pass the path of the program to the interpreter like so: 
```sh 
C:\Python27\python.exe C:\Users\Username\Desktop\my_python_script.py
```

## Goals - TBD
* Add config file for easier setup for users
   * Set embedded role messages to variables
   * Implement BOT_TOKEN
   * Move role dicts & emojis
* Move roles to function folder (OOP)
   * Try to implement a for loop to simplify the code
* Code optimization

## Release History
* 0.0.1
    * Work in progress
